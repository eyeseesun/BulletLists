# BulletLists
A tasklist tracker for creating small, meaningful, and reusable tasklists

## How to run

Ensure you have the Angular cli and Ionic cli. This is an Ionic 4.0 project, but it shouldn't make too much of a difference. Clone the repository and in the bulletlists folder run:

```
npm install
ionic serve
```

## What I learned

- I actually have a lot of abstract project work I could add to this.
- Portfolio design doesn't have to be glitzy or splashy, a one page spread can be nice.
- Routing can be a weird issue when you don't use your own domain and are a subpath pretending you're the root.

## What was used

- **Angular v6**
- **Font Awesome**
- **Photoshop** (For design and images)

## Where I'd go with it

- I'd like to add some relevant links at the top such as my github, and when I make one, my linked in, as well as my facebook where I'm throwing up a lot of my daily ui work.
- I'd like to add Bulletlists as one of my projects.
